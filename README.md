# Food_recipe_app_React
A food recipe app which allows users to search for different recipes. I built this project to further expand my knowledge in REACT and APIs. 

## Visit the web app
You can find the deployed app in the following link: https://artemis-p.github.io/Food_recipe_app_React/

## How to use
It's very simple! :) Just add the main ingredient you are looking recipes for (eg. raspberry) in the search box and hit the search button.

## Tech used:
- REACT
- CSS
- Edamam API
